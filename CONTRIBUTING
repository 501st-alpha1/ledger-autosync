Pull request for bugs and feature enhancements are welcome at:

  https://github.com/egh/ledger-autosync

If you are considering a large change, please open an issue first to
discuss any possible implications or best practices.

If writing a bug fix, please include a regression test that would fail
without the fix. If writing a new feature, testing that it works as
expected is very much appreciated.
